# Chirp

This project was realised by Lo√Øc Christen and Alexandre Venturi

To run this project you first need to clone the repository on your device with a git clone 

'''
git clone https://github.com/NotDonaldPump/Chirp.git
'''

In the case you want to run the project by a console you will need to navigate a bit through the folders

'''
cd Chirp
'''

We assume here you already have a version of Python and so you can install some package that are listed in the *requirement.txt*

'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''

Then you will need to run two python files : 'populate_database.py' and next 'redis_model.py'

'''
python chirp/populate_database.py
python chirp/redis_model.py
'''
